Title->Selection Sorting

Aim->To learn about objrct oriented programming in C++(about bubble sorting)

Theory->Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

Algorithm :
start=>Create a function selection(arr, size)=>Initialize an integer array arr with the elements to be sorted=>Call the selection function to sort the array arr=>Print the sorted array arr=>End

Explanation of the algorithm:
We begin with an unsorted array of integers.We create a function called selection to sort the array using the Selection Sort algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it in its correct position.We call the selection function to sort the array, moving the smallest elements to the beginning of the array in each pass.
