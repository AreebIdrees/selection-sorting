Title->Selection Sorting

Aim->To learn about objrct oriented programming in C++

Theory->Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.  

Algorithm :
start=>Create a function selection(arr, size)=>Initialize an integer array arr with the elements to be sorted=>Call the selection function to sort the array arr=>Print the sorted array arr=>End

Explanation of the algorithm:
We begin with an unsorted array of integers.We create a function called selection to sort the array using the Selection Sort algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it in its correct position.We call the selection function to sort the array, moving the smallest elements to the beginning of the array in each pass.
